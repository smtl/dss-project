This page lets you know the configurations and necessary programs to run this website.


= Details =

== Where to install ==

svn checkout into /var/www/ so that the files you download will have the correct locations in them.

== Python ==

Ubuntu comes with python but you still might need to install the devloper packages:

`sudo apt-get install python-dev`

== Django ==

We are using Django 1.3.1. The download and instructions to install can be found here:

https://www.djangoproject.com/download/

== Apache2 ==

`sudo apt-get install apache2`

`sudo apt-get install apache2-prefork-dev`

(If you want a graphical interface to control the server, you can use https://launchpad.net/localhost-indicator)

Commands to control the apache2 server are:

`sudo service apache2 start`
`sudo service apache2 stop`

== mod_wsgi ==

Download mod_wsgi from:

http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/detail?name=mod_wsgi-3.3.tar.gz&can=2&q=

`tar xvfz mod_wsgi-3.3.tar.gz`

`cd` into the new mod_wsgi folder

`./configure`

`make`

Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf to include this line:

`LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so`

`sudo make install`


(Note: After doing this you must stop the server and then start it again)
